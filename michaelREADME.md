Final Project submission

#Helped come up with the idea and the strategy of attacking the problem

#I made a script using Beautiful soup that can scrap info off of the world meter on coronavirus,

#https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ 

#given the state that the user is from, it will navigate the website to find the corresponding statistics for that state

#once it has the statistics, selenium will log onto a gmail account and send an email to the user with all the data 
  that the webscraper gathered
  
#I worked on each submission and also on the final submission doc
